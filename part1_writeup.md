# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
the r squared value is around 0.6 and is the accuracy models linear regression line
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old? 136

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I dont think this model's predictions are accurate to predict someones blood pressure based on their age because 0.6 is way too low of an accuaracy to predict medical data about someonething that could effect someones life
