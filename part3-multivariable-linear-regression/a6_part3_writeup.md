# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

the r-squared coef is 0.85. This means there is a strong correlation between the variables and result in my data.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

My model is accurate because the R-squared value is high and the accuracy is over 80%

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

10 year car: $9223

20 year car: $2770

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

I think this is happening because since the graph is linear as the x values increase the y decreases linearly meaning that eventualy the y values will be negative
